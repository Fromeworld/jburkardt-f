      TABLE_SHIFT <br> Shift a Table Dataset
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_SHIFT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      adjusts an M dimensional
      dataset of N points by adding a shift vector to each entry.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_SHIFT</b> expects the input data file to be in the simple
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">
      TABLE format</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was written partly to provide a visual check of
      the results of the
      <a href =
      "../../f_src/cvt_mod_dataset/cvt_mod_dataset.html">
      CVT_MOD_DATASET</a> program, which purports to produce a set of
      CVT points that "don't know about" the boundary.  If that's true,
      then the picture should be roughly isotropic.  That is, you shouldn't
      notice any significant difference between the pattern near or far
      from the boundaries.  It's hard to tell from a plot of the data
      whether this is so, but it is possible to use this program to make
      3 more copies of the data, shifted by (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1), then
      concatenate the original and three copies, and make a plot of the
      new data over [0,0] x [2,2], and see whether there are boundary effects.
      Such a comparison is made in the test data below.
    </p>

    <h3 aign = "center">
      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      For some reason, you need to concatenate two graphics files.
      For technical reasons, this will work, as long as we can increment
      all the indices in the second file by 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      File 1 looks like this:
      <pre>
        1  2  3
        4  5  6
        7  8  9
       10 11 12
      </pre>
      and File 2 looks like this:
      <pre>
        3  2  1
        6  5  4
        9  8  7
       12 11 10
      </pre>
      but we want the values in File 2 to be increased by 100 before we
      merge the files.  So we just say:

      <pre><b>
        table_shift <i>file2.txt</i>
      </b></pre>
      and then specify a shift vector of (100,100,100) to get
      a transformed File 2 that looks like this:
      <pre>
        103  102 101
        106  105 104
        109  108 107
        112  111 110
      </pre>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>table_shift</b> <i>file.txt</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the user's data file <i>file.txt</i>,
          prompts for a shift vector from the user, and then writes
          the shifted data to a file which will be called <i>file.shift.txt</i>.

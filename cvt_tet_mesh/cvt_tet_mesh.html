    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_TET_MESH</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies CVT methods to produce a tet mesh
      of various test regions in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, when using this program, we begin with a <i>region</i>,
      which is to be filled up with a number of (unspecified) points
      and then organized into tetrahedrons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other programs, such as <b>TABLE_TET_MESH</b>, are available for
      the case where the points are already given, and only the tetrahedrons
      need to be determined.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CVT points are written to files in the
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">
      TABLE format</a>.

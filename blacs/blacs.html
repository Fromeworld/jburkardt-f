      <b>BLACS</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      illustrate the use of the BLACS library.
    </p>

    <p>
      The BLACS, or "Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms",
      form a linear algebra-oriented message passing interface that may be
      implemented efficiently and uniformly across a large range of
      distributed memory platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The length of time required to implement efficient distributed memory
      algorithms makes it impractical to rewrite programs for every new
      parallel machine.  The BLACS exist in order to make linear algebra
      applications both easier to program and more portable.  It is for
      this reason that the BLACS are used as the communication layer of
      the distributed memory linear algebra package SCALAPACK, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      MPI is one example of a distributed memory system.  A program written
      at the BLACS level can run on under MPI.  The same program should run
      correctly on systems that use other distributed memory systems.  The
      key is that on each system, the installation of the BLACS library
      takes into account the interfact between the standard BLACS routines
      and the local distributed memory system.

      <b>BLACS_PRB</b> is a simple test in which a grid is set up, and each
      process reports in to the master process:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "blacs_prb.f90">blacs_prb.f90</a>, the sample problem;

        <li>
          <a href = "blacs_prb.sh">blacs_prb.sh</a>,
          commands to compile, link and run on an MPI distributed memory system
          that uses MPIRUN for execution;

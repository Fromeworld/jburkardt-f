      PITCON7 <br> The Continuation Method
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PITCON7</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements the continuation method for systems of nonlinear equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is designed for problems
      in which N variables <b>X</b> are constrained by N-1 nonlinear equations,
      which we may write as
      <blockquote><b>
        F(X) = 0
      </b></blockquote>
      Generally, there is an entire family of solutions to such a problem,
      which can be thought of as an implicitly defined curve in N-dimensional
      space.  We might write this as <b>X(LAMBDA)</b>, where <b>LAMBDA</b>
      is often thought of as arc length.  However, we only mention this
      in order to suggest that the solution points form a curve.  The
      parameterizing variable LAMBDA is not practically computable or
      necessary to know (and the actual structure of the <b>X</b> solutions
      could be more complicated than we suggest here.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Given one solution point on this curve (an approximate value will do),
      PITCON attempts to follow the curve of solutions that passes through
      that point, and to produce further solutions along the curve.  The
      program can be instructed to watch out for "target points",
      that is, points on the solution curve for which one of the variables
      attains a special value, and "limit points", for which some variable
      attains an extreme value.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple but tricky example, we mention the Freudenstein-Roth
      function, which has the form:
      <pre>
        FX(1) = X1 - X2*X2*X2 + 5*X2*X2 -  2*X2 - 13 + 34*(X3-1)
        FX(2) = X1 + X2*X2*X2 +   X2*X2 - 14*X2 - 29 + 10*(X3-1)
      </pre>
      A suitable starting point is (15,-2,0).  The program is typically
      asked to find a target point for which the X3 coordinate is 1, and
      to watch out for limit points in the first or third variables.
      Generally, the program will discover the target point (5,4,1),
      and will, if asked, also spot limit points in X1 at:
      <pre>
        (14.28309, -1.741377,  0.2585779)
         and
        (61.66936,  1.983801, -0.6638797)
      </pre>
      or limit points for the third variable, which occur at:
      <pre>
        (20.48586, -0.8968053, 0.5875873)
         and
        (61.02031,  2.230139, -0.6863528)
      </pre>
      If you have the program take small steps, so that you get a
      good image of the solution curve, you will see that there are
      a pair of hairpin turns along the path!
    </p>

    <p>
      If <b>PITCON</b> is allowed to take fairly large steps,
      a typical sequence of solution points might be:
      <pre>
        15.0000      -2.00000      0.000000E+00
        14.7105      -1.94205      0.653814E-01
        14.2846      -1.72915      0.268742
        16.9061      -1.20941      0.546845
        24.9179     -0.599064      0.555136
        34.8981     -0.405153E-01  0.353312
        44.8809      0.487811      0.594414E-01
        54.8607       1.09476     -0.304459
        61.3810       1.81339     -0.624499
       -48.6139       4.67873       2.88055
        5.00000       4.00000       1.00000
       </pre>
       Note that when the program computes the solution with
       X3 = 2.88055, it realizes that is has passed a target
       point where X3 = 1, so that it actually "goes back" and
       determines where that point lies.

      Problem 1 is a simple demonstration test, involving the Freudenstein-Roth
      function.  There are 2 equations, and 3 variables.  The solution curve has
      some severe bends.  This file solves the problem with a minimum of fuss.

      Problem 2 handles the Aircraft Stability problem.  There are 7 equations
      in 8 variables.  This is a mildly nonlinear problem, whose solution curve
      has some limit points that are difficult to track.

      Problem 3 is a boundary value problem with 22 variables.  This problem
      has a limit point in the LAMBDA parameter, which we seek.  We
      solve this problem 6 times, illustrating the use of full and banded
      jacobians, and of user-generated, or forward or central difference
      approximated jacobian matrices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first 21 variables represent the values of a function along a grid
      of 21 points between 0 and 1.  By increasing the number of grid points,
      the problem can be set up with arbitrarily many variables.  This change
      requires changing a single parameter in the main program.  Files you

      Problem 4 is another version of the Freudenstein Roth problem.
      This version of the problem tests the parameterization fixing option.
      The user may demand that PITCON always use a given index for continuation,
      rather than varying the index from step to step.  The Freudenstein-Roth
      curve may be parameterized by the variable of index 2, although this
      may increase the number of steps required to traverse the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      This file carries out 6 runs, with and without the parameterization fixed,
      and with no limit point search, or with limit points sought for index 1

      Problem 5 is another version of the boundary value problem
      This time, we do NOT seek the limit point in the LAMBDA parameter,
      but rather the two target points where LAMBDA=0.8, which occurs twice,
      before and after LAMBDA "goes around the bend".
    </p>

    <p>
      We run this test 3 times, comparing the behavior of the full Newton
      iteration, the Newton iteration that fixes the Jacobian during the
      correction of each point, and the Newton iteration that fixes the
      Jacobian as long as possible.  Files you may copy include:

      Problem 6 repeats the Freudenstein Roth function.
      This version of the problem demonstrates the jacobian checking option.
      Two runs are made.  Each is allowed only five steps.  The first
      run is with the correct jacobian.  The second run uses a defective
      jacobian, and demonstrates not only the jacobian checker, but also
      shows that "slightly" bad jacobians can cause the Newton convergence
      to become linear rather than quadratic.  Files you may copy include:

      Problem 7 is the materially nonlinear problem, with up to 71 variables.
      This is a two point boundary value problem, representing the behavior
      of a rod under a load.  The shape of the rod is represented by piecewise
      polynomials, whose form and continuity are specifiable as options.
      The problem as programmed can allow up to 71 variables, but a simple
      change of a few parameters will allow the problem to be arbitrarily
      large.

      This is a complicated program.  It is intended to demonstrate the
      advanced kinds of problems that can be solved with PITCON, as opposed
      to the "toy" problems like the Freudenstein-Roth function.
      is a simple demonstration test.  Files you may copy include:

      Problem 8 is a version of the Freudenstein-Roth function.
      This version of the problem tests the jacobian approximation options.
      We run the problem 3 times, first with the user jacobian, second with
      the forward difference approximation, and third with the central
      difference approximation.  Files you may copy include:

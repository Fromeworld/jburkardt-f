      CVT_FIXED2 <br> CVT with Some Generators Fixed
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_FIXED2</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      generates a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), with some nodes fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "interesting" routine in the library is <b>CVT_FIXED_ITERATION</b>,
      which updates an ongoing CVT calculation, but does not adjust certain
      nodes that have been designated by the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user also supplies a subroutine that samples the domain of
      interest.  If the domain is the unit square, say, then it is enough
      to return points uniformly distributed in [0,1].  However, the
      sampling subroutine interface makes it simple to handle regions
      which are not the unit square, or which have irregular boundaries,
      or holes, or for which a nonuniform probability density is to be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sample problem illustrates the use of this routine to generate
      a mesh of points in a region that has two hexagonal holes.  The
      user has set a number of points along the boundary, and on the
      holes, and these points are not to be moved.  More points are to
      be generated within the region, and these, together with the fixed
      points, will constitute the mesh.  The user also supplies a routine
      that returns sample points within the double hexagonal hole region.

      The CVT_FIXED2_PRB program can be used to handle the
      "double hexagonal hole" region.  A few lines in source code
      file "cvt_fixed2_prb.f90" must be set so that the appropriate
      files are read and written, and so that 511 nodes are created
      by the run.  Files you may copy include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "double_hex.txt">double_hex.txt</a>,
          a set of 96 fixed nodes for the double hexagonal hole region.

    <p>
      The CVT_FIXED2_PRB program can be used to handle a second version
      of the "double hexagonal hole" region which uses half as many
      fixed nodes.  A few lines in source code
      file "cvt_fixed2_prb.f90" must be set so that the appropriate
      files are read and written, and so that 139 nodes are created
      by the run.  Files you may copy include:

        <li>
          <a href = "double_hex2.txt">double_hex2.txt</a>,

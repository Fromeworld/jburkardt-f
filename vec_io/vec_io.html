    <p>
      <b>VEC_IO</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      provides a simple interface to read or write a set of
      vectors to a file, which are of a single fixed size.  The vectors
      can be read or written in any order.  Several sets of files can
      be handled at one time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A common procedure computationally involves computing a state
      variable U(T,X,Y) at a fixed set of nodes, and for an increasing
      sequence of equally spaced times.  For certain optimization
      problems, this process is followed by a <i>backwards</i> computation,
      in which the data is analyzed in reverse order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the data U(T,X,Y) for a single time step may require a
      large amount of storage, and usually only two sets of data
      are needed at any point in the computation, namely the values
      at the current time, and at the future or previous time, it
      is convenient to store the solution data for each timestep
      in a single file.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple use of <b>VEC_IO</b> allows the user to write each
      solution vector to the file in forward order, and then to
      read back the same solution data in reverse order.  Of course,
      more general access patterns are also available.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, the only kind of data that can be written or
      read is a double precision vector of length <b>N</b>.
      Sets of this data can be stored in an unformatted direct access file,
      or a formatted direct access file.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would also be useful to allow other data types, such
      as single precision or integer data, and other file formats,
      but this has not yet been set up.

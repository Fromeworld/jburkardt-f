    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_COLUMNS_PERMUTE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a text file, each of whose lines contains <b>COL_NUM</b>
      "words" or items.  It accepts a permutation from the user, and
      writes out a copy of the file after permuting the columns.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, suppose the file looks like this:
      <pre>
        # Comments look like this and are ignored.
        #
         cat  dog  horse
           1    2      3
         xxx   yy      z
      </pre>
      If we ran the program, and specified the permutation "2 3 1",
      then the new file would be
      <pre>
        # Comments look like this and are ignored.
        #
           horse cat  dog
               3   1    2
               z xxx   yy
      </pre>
      Notice that the permutation information specified that column
      1 should move to column 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      The input data is treated abstractly.  It is assumed to be
      separated by blanks, and each item, when permuted, will also
      include the initial blanks.  For this reason, it's best if
      the first entry of each data line is a blank, so that the
      first column of data will be properly delimited after being
      moved.

          <b>table_columns_permute</b> <i>file.txt</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the user's data file <i>file.txt</i>,
          prompts for a permutation vector from the user, and then writes
          the scaled data to a file which will be called <i>file.permuted.txt</i>.

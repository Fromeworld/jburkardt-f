    <p>
      <b>BAYES_DICE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      performs a simple demonstration of Bayesian Statistics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we're watching a "system" and trying to analyze its
      behavior.  Each time we observe the system, it rolls a die a
      certain number of times, and reports the results.  We want to
      estimate THETA(1) through THETA(6), the probabilities of each result.
    </p>

    <p>
      We treat the values of THETA as random variables themselves,
      controlled by a Dirichlet probability density function with
      parameters ALPHA(1) through ALPHA(6).  We make an arbitrary
      guess for initial ALPHA values.  We observe the system and
      adjust the ALPHA's using Bayes's Law.

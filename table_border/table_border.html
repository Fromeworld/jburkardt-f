      TABLE_BORDER <br> Add zero boundary values to a table
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_BORDER</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      adds a layer of zero boundary values to a table.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand what's going on, assume that we begin with
      a set of (scalar) values on an M by N grid; we illustrate with
      M = 3 and N = 5:
      <pre>
        11  12  13  14  15
        21  22  23  24  25
        31  32  33  34  35
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that this data represents the values of some quantity
      on the interior points of a 5 x 7 grid, and that we'd like
      to make a new version of the table which includes entries
      for these boundary values; that is, we want the M+2 by N+2
      array created by adding one row and column to the beginning
      and end of the original table, and setting those values to 0.
      For our example, this would be:
      <pre>
         0   0   0   0   0   0   0
         0  11  12  13  14  15   0
         0  21  22  23  24  25   0
         0  31  32  33  34  35   0
         0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>TABLE_BORDER</b> program is designed to do this, using
      the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we are probably going to be dealing with much larger sets of
      data, stored in a file.  So we have to figure out the rules for
      doing that:
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Input file format</i>: The initial data, which is "really" an
      M by N array, is to be thought of as a vector of length M * N,
      created by listing the first column, the second column, and so on
      to the last column.  This data is stored in a file using the
      <a href = "../../data/table/table.html">TABLE format</a>.  Our
      example data would be:
      <pre>
        # Comments are OK in a file if preceded by the comment character!
        #
        11
        21
        31
        12
        22
        ...
        34
        15
        25
        35
      </pre>
      We will presume this file is called <i>"u.txt"</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>(Pie in the Sky):</i> In a future version of this program,
      the data at each node will be allowed to be vector-valued.
      That's one reason we are forcing the data currently to be listed
      with just a single value per line in the file!

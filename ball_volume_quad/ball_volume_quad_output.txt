BALL_VOLUME_QUAD
  FORTRAN90 version
  Use a quadrature rule, applied to the M-dimensional
  hypercube, to estimate the volume of the 
  M-dimensional unit sphere.
 
  We are integrating the function f(x), where f(x) is
  * 1 inside the sphere;
  * 0 outside the spere.
 
  The function f(x) is discontinuous.  That suggests that
  as we use "better" and "better" quadrature rules, the
  volume estimate will actually get worse and worse.
 
  The user supplies the quadrature rule using three files,
  called the "R", "W" and "X" files:
  * the Mx2 R file contains the hyperrectangle of definition;
  * the Nx1 W file contains the weights.
  * the MxN X file contains the points.
 
User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "cc_d6_level0_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "cc_d6_level0_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "cc_d6_level0_r.txt".

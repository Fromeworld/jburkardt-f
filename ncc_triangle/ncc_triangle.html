      NCC_TRIANGLE <br> Newton-Cotes Closed Quadrature Rules for the Triangle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NCC_TRIANGLE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      defines the weights and abscisass for a sequence of
      9 Newton-Cotes closed quadrature rules for the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newton-Cotes rules have the characteristic that the abscissas
      are equally spaced.  For a triangle, this refers to spacing
      in the unit reference triangle, or in the barycentric coordinate
      system.  These rules may be mapped to an arbitrary triangle,
      and will still be valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules are said to be "closed" when they include points on
      the boundary of the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The use of equally spaced abscissas may be important for your
      application.  That may how your data was collected, for instance.
      On the other hand, the use of equally spaced abscissas carries
      a few costs.  In particular, for a given degree of polynomial
      accuracy, there will be rules that achieve this accuracy, but
      use fewer abscissas than Newton-Cotes.  Moreover, the Newton-Cotes
      approach almost always results in negative weights for some
      abscissas.  This is generally an undesirable feature, particularly
      when higher order quadrature rules are being used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the first rule included in the set is not, strictly
      speaking, a Newton-Cotes closed rule; it's just the rule that
      uses a single point at the centroid.  However, by including
      this rule as the first in the set, we have a rule with each
      polynomial degree of exactness from 0 to 8.

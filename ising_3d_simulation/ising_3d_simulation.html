      ISING_3D_SIMULATION <br> Monte Carlo 3D Ising Model
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ISING_3D_SIMULATION</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      carries out a Monte Carlo simulation of a 3D Ising model.
    </p>

    <p>
      The text of this Ising model appeared as an example in the ANSI
      FORTRAN90 standard in 1992.  It is a nice presentation of how to use
      certain features of FORTRAN90, and also demonstrates why one would like
      to use these features - they make the Ising calculation very simple
      to describe.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>ising_3d_simulation</b> <i>n</i> <i>iterations</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>n</i> is the number of cells in each dimension.  The total number of cells
          will be <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>iterations</i> is the number of iterations to take.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Note that the user might also want to vary the transition probabilities.
      This cannot currently be done on the command line, and requires editing
      the program and recompiling it.

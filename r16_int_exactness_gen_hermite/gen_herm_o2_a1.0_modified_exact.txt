INT_EXACTNESS_GEN_HERMITE_R16
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a generalized Gauss-Hermite
  quadrature rule by integrating exponentially weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the (-oo,oo) interval.
 
INT_EXACTNESS_GEN_HERMITE_R16: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "gen_herm_o2_a1.0_modified_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "gen_herm_o2_a1.0_modified_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "gen_herm_o2_a1.0_modified_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =        5
  Weighting function exponent ALPHA =    1.00000    
  OPTION = 1, integrate                     f(x).
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        2
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a generalized Gauss-Hermite rule
  ORDER =        2
  ALPHA =    1.00000    
 
  OPTION = 1, modified rule:
    Integral ( -oo < x < oo ) f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).
 
  Weights W:
 
  w( 1) =    1.359140914229523    
  w( 2) =    1.359140914229523    
 
  Abscissas X:
 
  x( 1) =  -1.0000000000000000    
  x( 2) =   1.0000000000000000    
 
  Region R:
 
  r( 1) =  -0.1000000000000000E+31
  r( 2) =   0.1000000000000000E+31
 
  A generalized Gauss-Hermite rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        3

      FEM2D_STOKES_INOUT <br> "Inout" Routines for FEM2D_STOKES
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_STOKES_INOUT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      supplies information defining a Stokes flow problem in the "inout" region.
      The "inout" region is a square region that is 1 unit wide and 1 unit
      high.  A parabolic inflow is specified on the lower left, and
      a zero Neumann outflow is specified on the upper right.
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the problem directly, you only need the user-supplied routines
      in <b>inout.f90</b>, the node data in <b>nodes6.txt</b>, and the
      element data in <b>triangles6.txt</b>.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      You compile and link the solver with <b>cavity.f90</b>, using
      commands like:
      <pre>
        gfortran fem2d_stokes.f90 inout.f90
        mv a.out inout
      </pre>
      and then run the program with the command
      <pre>
        ./inout nodes6.txt triangles6.txt
      </pre>
    </p>

      The geometry is defined by sets of nodes and triangles.
      The velocities use the full set of nodes,
      and quadratic (6 node) triangles.

      The pressures are associated with a subset of the nodes
      called "pressure nodes", and linear (3 node) triangles.
      Note that, in the order 3 triangulation, the nodes are renumbered,
      and do NOT inherit the labels used in the order 6 triangulation.

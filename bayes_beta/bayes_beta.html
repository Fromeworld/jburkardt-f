    <p>
      <b>BAYES_BETA</b>
      if a FORTRAN90 program which
      is a simple Bayesian Statistics demonstration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we're watching a "system" and trying to analyze its behavior.
      Each time we observe the system, it flips a coin a certain number of
      times, and reports the number of heads and tails.  We want to estimate
      THETA1 and THETA2, the probabilities of heads and of tails.
    </p>

    <p>
      We treat the values of THETA1 and THETA2 as random variables
      themselves, controlled by a Beta probability density function, which has
      parameters ALPHA1 and ALPHA2.  We make an arbitrary or informed guess
      for initial values of ALPHA1 and ALPHA2.  We observe the system,
      and adjust ALPHA1 and ALPHA2 using Bayes's Law.  We continue until
      we are satisfied that our estimates seem to have converged.

    <p>
      <b>PDB_EXTRACT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts certain columns from certain lines of a
      Protein Data Bank file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, the controls for which lines are to be considered, and what
      data is to be extracted, are hardwired into the code.  For instance, we
      might want to consider every line in which the fourth word is "CA", and
      for those lines, we would write out columns 9 and 10.

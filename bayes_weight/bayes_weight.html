      BAYES_WEIGHT <br> Estimate Mixture PDF Weights

    <p>
      <b>BAYES_WEIGHT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      demonstrates Bayesian analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program estimates the weights used in a mixture probability density
      function (PDF).  In the case examined here, the parameters of
      the PDF's are known, but the mixing weights are not.  It is
      the task of the program to observe the system and estimate these
      weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each event will be a roll of a die.  We have two dice to choose from,
      each with a different characteristic probability density function.
      For each event, the probability we will choose die #1 or die #2 are
      the unknowns W1 and W2.  We start with a guess for these values,
      but after each roll, we adjust our guesses based on the product of
      the likelihoods of observing this result given that density,
      and our previously estimated likelihood of that density.

CVT_BASIS
  Arrange a set of PDE solution data into clusters.
 
  Null cluster policy:
  0, do nothing, accept null clusters;
  1, reset center to a random data point;
  2, reset center to random point in hull;
 
  NULL_CLUSTER_POLICY =      0
 
RANDOM_INITIALIZE
  Initialize RANDOM_NUMBER with user SEED =     12345678
 
What is the run type?
 
  RUN_TYPE =      6
 
  For RUN_TYPE = 6, T-Cell data.
  read in the steady state solution from "STEADY.TXT"
  and, letting SS be the steady state solution,
  subtract 5/3 SS from solutions 1 through 250
  subtract 1/3 SS from solutions 251 through 500.
  We do NOT normalize the result.
 
What is the name of the XY data file?
 
  The file "/math/WWW/f_src/cvt_basis_tcell/xy.txt" contains 4961 lines.
 
  X minimum :    0.00000    
  X maximum :    1.00000    
  Y minimum :    0.00000    
  Y maximum :    1.00000    
 
What is the name of the steady state file?
 
  Steady state information was read from
  the file "/math/WWW/f_src/cvt_basis_tcell/steady.txt".
 
  Steady max norm =    3.00284    
  Steady l2 norm =     121.425    
 
What is the name of the first solution file?
 
We believe the number of solution files is    500
 
  The data is stored in an M by N matrix.
 
  The "spatial" dimension M is     9922
  The number of data points N is    500
 
All the data has been read into POINT.
 
Enter lower and upper number of clusters
 
  The program will try to determine the minimum energy
  of a clustering, for cluster sizes in the range:
       4     4
 
Enter the number of different random cluster configurations to check
 
  For each number of clusters, the number of
  distinct initial random configurations to be checked
  will be      15
 
Enter the number of energy iterations
 
  For each initial random configuration, the number of
  times the program will recompute the cluster centers,
  cluster components, and energy is     30
 
Enter 0 to use raw data, 1 to use normalized data.
 
NORMAL = 0
  Data will NOT be normalized.
 
Number of clusters allowed:      4

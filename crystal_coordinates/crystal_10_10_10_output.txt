CRYSTAL:
  Generate the coordinates of a set of points
  in a 3D crystal with FCC symmetry.
 
  Reminder:
  For the Lennard-Jones potential, truncated at 2.5, 
    a_eq = 1.5496 Angstroms at P=0;
  For the Al glue system,
    a_eq = 4.032 Angstroms at P=0.
 
  Enter the lattice spacing A: 
 
  Reminder:
  For the minimum image with the Lennard-Jones 
  potential, the minimum number of cells along
  the X, Y, and Z directions is:
           2
  or, for the Al glue system:
           4
 
  Enter the number of cells along the X direction: 
  Enter the number of cells along the Y direction: 
  Enter the number of cells along the Z direction: 
  Enter the maximum random displacement: 
 
  Enter the name of the coordinate file: 
 
CRYSTAL read the following user parameters:
 
  ALAT      = the cell spacing.
  NX        = number of cells in the X direction.
  NY        = number of cells in the Y direction.
  NZ        = number of cells in the Z direction.
  DISPLAC   = maximum random displacement.
  FILE_NAME = the output file name
 
  ALAT      =    3.00000    
  NX        =     10
  NY        =     10
  NZ        =     10
  DISPLAC   =   0.100000    
  FILE_NAME = "crystal_10_10_10.txt".
 
  The coordinate data was written to "crystal_10_10_10.txt".
 
CRYSTAL:
  Normal end of execution.

    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ISING_2D_SIMULATION</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      carries out a Monte Carlo simulation of a 2D Ising model.
    </p>

    <p>
      A 2D Ising model is defined on an MxN array of cells.  Each cell
      can have a "charge" or "spin" of +1 or -1.  A neighborhood of a cell is defined to
      be itself, and the four immediate neighbors to the north, south, east, and
      west.  A cell may change its charge; the likelihood of doing so depends
      on whether the charge of the neighbors agrees with the charge of the cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program begins with a random assignment of charges to the cells.
      It then computes the neighbor agreement at each cell.  It then updates 
      the entire configuration in one step, using the neighbor agreement
      to determine the likelihood of flipping.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the chance that a cell will "flip" is determined from a table
      of probabilities based on the number of agreeing neighbors:
    </p>

    <p>
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>Agree</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Prob</th><td>0.98</td><td>0.85</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.02</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>ising_2d_simulation</b> <i>m</i> <i>n</i> <i>iterations</i> <i>thresh</i> <i>seed</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the number of rows and columns of cells.
          The default values are 10.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>iterations</i> is the number of iterations to take.  The default value is 15.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>thresh</i> is a number between 0 and 1 that chooses the percentage of
          negative (red) charges.  The default value is 0.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>seed</i> is a seed for the random number generator.  The default
          value is 123456789.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the user might also want to vary the transition probabilities.
      This cannot currently be done on the command line, and requires editing
      the program and recompiling it.

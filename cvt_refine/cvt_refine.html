      CVT_REFINE <br> Refine a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_REFINE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      attempts to "refine"
      a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_REFINE</b> considers the following problem.  We suppose
      that we have computed a centroidal Voronoi tessellation
      associated with N1 cell generators.  We now wish to
      "refine" this tessellation, by increasing the number of generators
      by N2.  The stipulations are that the old generators will be
      fixed in place, and that the new generators will be placed
      initially at random in the region, and then allowed to adjust
      themselves using the usual CVT iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, without some care, this process will not produce
      very good results, since the old fixed generators will "block"
      the motion of the new generators seeking areas of "lower
      pressure".  To enable the system to reach a lower energy
      equilibrium, we use a weight vector to initially reduce
      the influence of the old generators, and then to gradually
      "turn them on" until they are equal in influence to the
      new generators (though still constrained not to move).
    </p>

    <p>
      The code includes the weight vector that was developed in the
      <a href = "../../f_src/cvt_size/cvt_size.html">CVT_SIZE</a> program
      and the idea of fixing points that was developed in the
      <a href = "../../f_src/cvt_fixed/cvt_fixed.html">CVT_FIXED</a> program.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new idea was to include a maximum influence distance
      <b>cvt_cutoff</b>.  The idea was that spatial points that
      were further than this cutoff distance to a generator were
      not assigned any generator at all.  This was another mechanism
      that would allow us to control the sizes of the Voronoi cells,
      and allow new generators to move more freely around old,
      fixed generators.

    <p>
      Just to check out the use of the cutoff value, we set
      10 points going with a fixed cutoff value.

    <p>
      For our second movie, we follow 10 generators for 100 iterations,
      then fix them in place.  Our goal is to refine the current placement
      of points by adding some new points and driving them to a CVT
      equilibrium.  We add 10 new generators.  By a programming mistake,
      these points all started out at (0,0), but that just makes the point
      more dramatically.  We make room for the new points to move about
      by using weights.  These start out giving the new points an advantage,
      but at certain time steps we cut this back until at the end we
      are back to an unweighted scheme.

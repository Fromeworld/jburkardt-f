The FLOW3 program works on an underlying fluid flow problem, whose
behavior is determined by a particular version of the Navier Stokes
equations.
 
The fluid flow in the region is described by three functions of position,
the horizontal velocity U(x,y),  vertical velocity V(x,y), and pressure 
P(x,y).  In theory, these functions may be determined once we know the
partial differential equations that govern them within the region, and
the value of the functions or certain derivatives of them along the boundary 
of the region.

For our work, we assume that at every point within the flow region, the flow 
functions obey the Navier Stokes equations for stationary, incompressible, 
viscous flow:
 
  - nu*(ddU/dxdx + ddU/dydy) + U dU/dx + V dU/dy + dP/dx  = 0
 
  - nu*(ddV/dxdx + ddV/dydy) + U dV/dx + V dV/dy + dP/dy  = 0
 
  dU/dx + dV/dy = 0
 
Here, nu is a physical parameter called the "dynamic viscosity," 

We prefer the equivalent formulation (when nu is nonzero):

  - (ddU/dxdx + ddU/dydy) + Re*(U dU/dx + V dU/dy + dP/dx)  = 0
 
  - (ddV/dxdx + ddV/dydy) + Re*(U dV/dx + V dV/dy + dP/dy)  = 0
 
  dU/dx + dV/dy = 0

where Re is taken to be the Reynolds number.  

If Re=0, the problem is linear, and is called a Stokes flow.

To complete the specification of the problem, we specify boundary conditions
for the flow functions as follows:

  The values of U and V are specified along the inflow boundary;
  U and V must be zero along the upper and lower walls, and on the surface
    of the bump;
  dU/dn must be zero, and V must be zero, at the outflow;
  P must be zero at a single point on the boundary.
 

DERIVATION OF FINITE ELEMENT EQUATIONS

Except for special cases, such as the Poiseuille flow solution discussed
elsewhere, there are no methods of producing the exact solution functions
U, V and P for a general Navier Stokes problem.  In order to get any
insight into flow problems, we must replace the original problem by one
that is much weaker.  It's important that the weaker problem be possible
to solve, and that the solutions produced are in general close to solutions
of the original problem, and that these solutions can be made even closer,
if desired.

A standard method of doing this is to use the method of finite elements.

To do so, we assume that instead of being smooth but otherwise completely 
arbitrary functions, that U, V and P are representable as linear
combinations of a finite set of basis functions.

We multiply the first two equations by an arbitrary velocity basis 
function Wi, and the third equation by an arbitrary pressure basis
function Qi, and integrate over the region.  The integrand of the 
resulting finite element equations is then transformed, using 
integration by parts, into:
 
 
  nu*(dU/dx*dWi/dx + dU/dy*dWi/dy) + (U*dU/dx + V*dU/dy + dP/dx ) * Wi
 
  nu*(dV/dx*dWi/dx + dV/dy*dWi/dy) + (U*dV/dx + V*dV/dy + dP/dy ) * Wi
 
  (dU/dx + dV/dy) * Qi
 

These integrands may be rewritten using the program's variable names:
 

  dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dUdx+V*dUdy+dPdx)*wi
 
  dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dVdx+V*dVdy+dPdy)*wi
 
  (dUdx + dVdy) * qi
 

This system of nonlinear equations is then solved by Newton's method.
That means that we have to differentiate each nonlinear equation
with respect to the unknowns, getting the Jacobian matrix, and
solving DF(X) * DEL(X) = -F(X).  If we abuse notation, we can
consider the linear system DF(X) * DEL(X):

Here, variables in capital letters are to be solved for, but
the same variable names in lowercase represent the current
values of those same variables.
 
 
d Horizontal Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
 
  dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+v*dUdy)*wi
 
d Horizontal Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
 
                            reynld*V*dudy*wi
 
d Horizontal Equation/d P coefficient * P coefficient:
 
                            reynld*dPdx*wi
 
d Vertical Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
 
                            reynld*U*dvdx*wi
 
d Vertical Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
 
  dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy + reynld*(u*dVdx+v*dVdy+V*dvdy)*wi
 
d Vertical Equation/d P coefficient * P coefficient:
 
                            reynld*dPdy*wi
 
d Pressure Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
 
  dUdx * qi
 
d Pressure Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
 
  dVdx * qi 
 
 
Now let us assume that U, V and P depend in some way on a parameter
Z, and let us consider differentiating each of the three above
equations with respect to Z.  Then we interchange differentiation
where desired, and come up with equations for the SENSITIVITIES.
 
Now the sensitivities should be written as (dU/dZ, dV/dZ, dP/dZ).
In the ensuing equations, we will write them as (U, V, P), but
now the lower case letters (u, v, p) represent the current values
of the original fluid flow quantities.


Sensitivity equations for the inflow parameters:
 
  dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi = 0
 
  dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi = 0
 
  (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
 
  Boundary conditions:

  0 at walls and at the outflow.

  Spline(I,Y) at the point (0,Y) of the inflow.  Here, Spline(I,Y) is
  the value of the spline associated with the I-th inflow parameter,
  at the point Y.
 
 
Sensitivity equations for the bump parameters:
 
  dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi = 0
 
  dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi = 0
 
  (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
 
  Boundary conditions:

  0 everywhere except on the bump.

  ? on the bump.
 
 
Sensitivity equations for the REYNLD parameter:

  dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi
    +        (u*dudx+v*dudy+dpdx)*wi = 0
 
  dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy 
    + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi
    +        (u*dvdx+v*dvdy+dpdy)*wi = 0
 
  (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
 
  Boundary conditions:

  0 everywhere.
 
In the case of the REYNLD parameter, we carry the "extra" terms

  (u*dvdx+v*dvdy+dpdy)*wi

to the right hand side, and treat it as a source term.  In that case,
all these sensitivity equations have the same form as the original
equations for (U, V, P).

Poiseuille flow


Consider a horizontal channel of constant height h, and of length l.

Suppose a parabolic inflow is specified at the left hand opening,
of the form

  u(y) = s * y * (h-y)
  v(y) = 0
  p(y) = 0

where S is any value.

Then the following functions (U,V,P) solve the Navier Stokes
equations in the region:

  u(x,y) = s * y * (h-y)
  v(x,y) = 0
  p(x,y) = -2*s*x*nu
 
The standard problem we use has h=3, l=10, and chooses a parameter Lambda
so that the maximum value of the parabolic inflow is Lambda.  Then our
formula becomes:

  u(x,y) = Lambda * (4/9) * y * (3-y)
  v(x,y) = 0
  p(x,y) = -2 * Lambda * (4/9) * x * Re

The following technical information describes various geometric facts
about the program.
 
 
1) The finite element nodes

If the region is rectangular, then FLOW3 places the nodes in such a way
that they are evenly spaced in the X direction, and in the Y direction,
although these two spacings may be different.

The first node is in the lower left corner.  The second node is the one
immediately above the first, and then numbering proceeds upwards, and then
over to the next column.  For instance:

Y=3.00       13          26          39          42          65

List of variables


A      real ( kind = 8 ) A(MAXROW,MAXEQN).
       A contains a matrix in LINPACK general band storage mode.
       The two dimensional array is of logical dimensions NROW by 
       NEQN.
       A is used in LINSYS.  If LINSYS is called by NSTOKE, then
       A is an iteration matrix, and play a role similar to that
       played by the Jacobian in a Newton iteration.
 
AREA   real ( kind = 8 ) AREA(MAXELM,3).
       AREA contains a common factor multiplying the term associated
       with a quadrature point in a given element, namely,
         AREA(IELEM,IQUAD) = Ar(IELEM) * WQUAD(IQUAD)
       or, if the element is isoperimetric,
         AREA(IELEM,IQUAD) = DET * Ar(IELEM) * WQUAD(IQUAD)
       Here Ar(IELEM) represents the area of element IELEM.

COST   real ( kind = 8 ) COST.
       COST contains the current value of the cost function.  This 
       is the function which the optimizer is to minimize.
       COST = WATEP*COSTP + WATEB*COSTB + WATEU*COSTU + WATEV*COSTV 

COSTB  real ( kind = 8 ) COSTB.
       COSTB is the integral of the difference of the derivatives 
       of the straight line joining the two straight line 
       segments of the bottom, and the bump that is actually 
       drawn there.  
       This measures the cost of bump control.

COSTP  real ( kind = 8 ) COSTP.
       The integral of the difference between
       the computed and target pressure functions along the
       profile line.

       The integral of the difference between
       the computed and target horizontal velocity functions along 
       the profile line.

COSTV  real ( kind = 8 ) COSTV.
       The integral of the difference between
       the computed and target vertical velocity functions along 
       the profile line.
 
DOPT   real ( kind = 8 ) DOPT(NPAR).
       DOPT contains a set of scale factors for the parameters, used
       by the optimization code.  The suggestion is that DOPT(I) be
       chosen so that DOPT(I)*PARA(I) is roughly the same order of
       magnitude for I from 1 to NPAR.

DPARA  real ( kind = 8 ) DPARA(NPAR).
       DPARA(I) is the partial derivative of the cost function with
       respect to the I-th parameter.

EPSDIF real ( kind = 8 ) EPSDIF.
       A small quantity, which is used to compute the perturbations
       for the finite difference approximations.

EQN    character*2 EQN(MAXEQN).
       EQN records the "type" of each equation that will be generated, and
       which is associated with an unknown.  Note that most boundary 
       conditions do not result in an equation.  The current values are:
       'U'  The horizontal momentum equation.
       'UB' The condition U=0 applied at a node on the bump.
       'UI' The condition U=UInflow(Y,Lambda) at the inflow.
       'UW' The condition U=0 applied at a node on a fixed wall.

       'V'  The vertical momentum equation.
       'VB' The condition V=0 applied at a node on the bump.
       'VI' The condition V=VInflow(Y,Lambda) at the inflow.
       'VW' The condition V=0 applied at a node on a fixed wall.

       'P'  The continuity equation.
       'PB' The condition P=0 applied at (XMAX,YMAX).

ETAN   real ( kind = 8 ) ETAN(6).
       The "Eta" coordinates of the six nodes in the reference element.

ETAQ   real ( kind = 8 ) ETAQ(3).
       The "Eta" coordinates of the quadrature points.

F      real ( kind = 8 ) F(NEQN).
       F is used as a right hand side vector in LINSYS, and is 
       overwritten there by the new solution, which is then copied 
       into G.
 
FILEG  character FILEG*30.
       FILEG contains the name of the file into which the DISPLAY 
       graphics information will be stored.
 
FILET  character FILET*30.
       FILET is a text file which can be used to store data
       during a marching run.
 
G      real ( kind = 8 ) G(NEQN).
       G is the current solution vector, in which are stored 
       pressures and velocities.

G2     real ( kind = 8 ) G2(NEQN).
       A temporary vector, used during the Newton iteration.
       It holds a copy of the first point in the Newton iteration,
       which allows us to restart the process if necessary.

GOPT   real ( kind = 8 ) GOPT(NOPT).

       nor end on PARA2, simply specify:
         ISTEP1, the step on which PARA should equal PARA1.
         ISTEP2, the step on which PARA should equal PARA2.
       The program will proceed as before, but pass through
       PARA1 and PARA2 at the specified times (unless ISTEP1
       or ISTEP2 are out of range, which is legal).

       Controls the type of run being made.
       1, a one dimensional "marching run".  The code will 
       generate a series of points evenly spaced along the line

       where PARA1 and PARA2 are computed may be specified by
       setting ISTEP1 and ISTEP2.  
       2, a two dimensional "marching run". The code will 
       generate a series of points on an evenly spaced grid
       over the parallelogram defined by the points PARA1,
       PARA2 and PARA3.  The points where PARA1, PARA2 and
       PARA3 are computed may be specified by setting ISTEP1,
       ISTEP2, JSTEP1 and JSTEP2.

       generate a series of points on an evenly spaced grid
       over the parallelogram defined by the points PARA1,

       solution for PARA1.  Then increment each component of

       JJAC=1, the moderately priced and sensible choice.
       The jacobian is evaluated and factored for every Newton iterate,
       except for gradient points.  The user may specify a "skip"
       frequency using IJAC.
       JJAC=2, the cheap but dangerous choice.
       The jacobian is evaluated once.  Then it is used as long as it
       can be, until a Newton process fails.  Then it is reevaluated,
       and we try to stretch the new jacobian as far as it will go.
       JJAC=3, user controllable cheapness.
       The user specifies DISJAC, a maximum parameter distance.
       If the new parameters are less than DISJAC from PARJAC,

       PARA is the current estimate for the parameters.
       For an optimization (ITYPE=0), PARA is started at PARA1,
       and is then updated by the optimizer.
       For a march (ITYPE=1), PARA starts at PARA1 and ends at

       immediately, if the difference between PAR and PAROLD is 
       less than STPMAX.
       If the difference is greater, then continutation from

    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PS_LG_ALIGN</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements some of the string
      alignment algorithms described in the reference <b>[Chao]</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These
      algorithms carry out the computation in <I>linear space</I>, and compute
      not just the optimal alignment score, but also the corresponding optimal
      alignment.  The alignments considered are local, that is, only
      contiguous portion of the sequence is mapped to a portion of the profile.
      Gaps in the alignment are assigned an affine gap penalty.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to be able to compute alignments using "linear space",
      that is, just a few vectors whose length <b>N</b> is equal to that
      of a typical string.  A quadratic algorithm would require a two
      dimensional array of total dimension <b>N*N</b>.  Realistic alignment
      problems can involve strings of <b>N</b>=100,000 elements or more,
      so a quadratic algorithm would be expensive or impossible to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optimal alignment score is computed without explicitly constructing
      the corresponding alignment.  So a major feature of the algorithms is
      how to backtrack from the score to retrieve the alignment.  It is a matter
      of some difficulty to recover  the matching, particularly if the best
      score was calculated with a linear space algorithm, which discards a
      great deal of intermediate information.  However, the linear space
      algorithm implemented here can also compute the optimal matching, based
      on the idea of a recursive subdivision of the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This set of algorithms does not actually match a pair of sequences,
      but rather matches a sequence to a "profile".  A profile is constructed
      based on information from many sequences, and can be thought of as
      a "generalized sequence", or a set of indices, where for each index
      we specify the likelihood that each possible nucleic acid will occur.
      These likelihoods can then be used to score the alignments we consider
      with the new candidate sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      This set of routines assumes that an insertion or deletion of length
      <b>K</b> is penalized using an "affine gap penalty formula" of the form:
      <blockquote>
        Penalty = Gap_Open + K * Gap_Extend
      </blockquote>
      This choice of penalty function has a major effect on the form
      of the matching algorithms, particularly in the linear space case.
      For the profile problems covered by these algorithms, the gap penalties
      are further adjusted using profile-position percentages specified by
      the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines that use quadratic space are included as well, so the algorithms
      can be compared for storage, speed, and correctness.

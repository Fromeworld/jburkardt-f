      CVT_SIZE <br> CVT with Prescribed Cell Sizes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_SIZE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      attempts to compute a
      (weighted) centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) in which each cell
      has a desired prescribed size.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, given arbitrary initial data and a constant density,
      the CVT would comprise cells of roughly equal area.  This program
      modifies the CVT iteration, allowing the user to specify
      a relative cell size for each cell.  Thus, if the region
      has area 100, and we make a tessellation of two cells, and
      we specify weights of 1 and 3, we would hope for the cells
      to be computed with areas of 25 and 75 units respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Internally, the desired cell sizes are normalized, and
      then the appropriate root is taken to account for the
      dimensionality of the space.  (In 2 space, you take the
      square root of the normalized cell size, for instance.)
      This gives you the weight to be assigned to a generator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, when it is time to compute the distance for a sample
      point to the center of each Voronoi cell and take the
      "closest" one, we divide each cell's distance by the adjusted
      weight.  This has the effect of making cells with a larger
      weight seem closer than they really are, and hence they
      attract more sample points, and end up with a larger area.
    </p>

    <p>
      If only a small number of generators are used, or if the
      weights vary greatly in size, the effects
      of local geometry and curvature come into play, and the
      chosen weights produce areas that are only roughly what is
      desired.  Increasing the number
      of cells being used seems to produce more regular behavior,
      with the cells tending to have the areas requested by the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the activity on this project was inspired by
      a query from Professor Alexandru Telea, of the Department
      of Mathematics and Computer Science, Technische
      Universiteit Eindhoven.

      We were interested in watching the behavior of the Voronoi
      cells over "time".  We set up a problem with 10 generators,
      with weights 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.  We started with random initial
      locations for the generators, and carried out 100 iterations
      of the CVT code.  We saved a
      <a href = "../../data/ppmb/ppmb.html">PPMB</a> file containing
      an image of each step, used the
      <a href = "http://www.ijg.org/">CJPEG</a>
      program to convert these to
      <a href = "../../data/jpg/jpg.html">JPEG files</a> with
      consecutive file names, fed that into
      <a href = "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">QuickTime Pro</a>
      to create an animation, and saved the result as an MPEG-4
      file.

CVT_FIXED_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Demonstrate a CVT algorithm in which some
  generators are held fixed.
 
Geometry parameters:
-------------------
 
  The spatial dimension is DIM_NUM =   2
 
  The minimum corner of the bounding box is:
    0.0000    0.0000
  The maximum corner of the bounding box is:
   10.0000   10.0000
 
CVT Algorithm parameters:
-------------------------
 
  The number of Voronoi cells to generate:       14
  Number of sampling points:    70000
  Number of centroid iterations:       10
  The influence cutoff distance:    4.00000    
  Voronoi cell generators are initialized by RANDOM_NUMBER.
 
 
RANDOM_INITIALIZE
  Initialize RANDOM_NUMBER with user SEED =    123454321
 
  Initializing the cell generators.
 
  Carry out the CVT iteration.
 
CVT_FIXED_PRB
  Normal end of execution.

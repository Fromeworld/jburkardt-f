      TABLE_ORTHONORMALIZE <br> Orthonormalize a Set of Vectors
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_ORTHONORMALIZE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      can read in a set of vectors and
      orthonormalize them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Caution</i>: it may not be clear from the documentation, but
      the program implicitly assumes that each vector represents a
      velocity field, and hence can be thought of as a quantity
      V(M/2,2), where "M" is the appropriate dimension if we think of
      the quantity as a vector of scalar values.  Moreover, each
      vector is written to a file as M/2 records of pairs of values.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, the program can read three (or in general <b>N</b>)
      files, each containing one of the M-dimensional vectors
      <b>v<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>v<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>3</sub></b>.
      The program then outputs three new vectors <b>q<sub>1</sub></b>,
      <b>q<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>q<sub>3</sub></b>, with the properties that
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Euclidean norm of <b>q<sub>i</sub></b> is 1, for all <b>i</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          The dot product <b>q<sub>i</sub>&#149;q<sub>j</sub></b> is 0,
          for <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> distinct;
        </li>
        <li>
          The vectors <b>q<sub>i</sub></b> span the same space as the
          original vectors <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm collects the <b>N</b> input vectors <b>v<sub>j</sub></b>
      into an <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> matrix <b>V</b>.  It then
      calls the appropriate LAPACK routines (<b>SGEQRF</b> and <b>SORGQR</b>)
      to compute the QR factorization:
      <pre><b>
        V = Q * R
      </b></pre>
      and outputs the individual columns of <b>Q</b> as the new vectors
      <b>q<sub>j</sub></b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This routine can be useful as a postprocessing tool for the output
      from
      <a href = "../cvt_basis/cvt_basis.html">CVT_BASIS</a> for example.
      However, orthonormalization would probably <i>not</i> be appropriate
      if <b>CVT_BASIS</b> had done its computations using
      mass matrix preconditioning.  In that case, the output vectors
      have a special orthogonality property under an L2 inner product,
      which would be lost if the vectors were processed by this program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some effort has been made to relieve the user of the tedious
      necessity of specifying how many input files there are (the number
      <b>N</b>), and what their dimensionality is (the number <b>M</b>).
      It is assumed that the input data files have "consecutive" names,
      such as <i>file01.txt</i>, <i>file02.txt</i>, ... and so on.
      This is enough to figure out <b>N</b>.  And the program counts
      the number of lines in the first file, and assumes this value
      of <b>M</b> may safely be applied to all the files.

    <p>
      <b>G95_QUADMATH</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      illustrates the use of quadruple real precision arithmetic
      with the G95 compiler for FORTRAN.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every FORTRAN compiler offers a default real datatype as well as a double
      precision real data type.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting with FORTRAN90, it become possible to describe these types in terms
      of a KIND parameter.  The actual values of the KIND parameter corresponding
      to particular types was left up to the compiler writer.  For G95,
      real and double precision variables can be declared with KIND values of 4
      and 8 respectively:
      <blockquote><b>
        REAL ( KIND = 4 ) W<br>
        REAL ( KIND = 8 ) X
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      On some systems, the G95 compiler provides a real data type stored in
      80 bytes, specified by a KIND value of 10, and on some systems, a data type
      stored in 128 bytes, with a KIND of 128.  Variable declarations would be
      <blockquote><b>
        REAL ( KIND = 10 ) Y<br>
        REAL ( KIND = 16 ) Z
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Macintosh OSX system I have access to seems to have the KIND = 10 and KIND = 16
      options for the G95 compiler.

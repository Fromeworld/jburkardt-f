      SPIRAL_DATA <br> Velocity Vector Field Satisfying Continuity Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPIRAL_DATA</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      samples a velocity vector field that satisfies the
      continuity equation, and writes the nodes and velocities to files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The continuous velocity field <b>(U,V)(X,Y)</b> that is discretely
      sampled here satisfies the homogeneous continuity equation, that is,
      it has zero divergence.  In other words:
      <pre><b>
        dU/dX + dV/dY = 0.
      </b></pre>
      This is by construction, since we have
      <pre><b>
        U(X,Y) =  10 * d/dY ( PHI(X) * PHI(Y) )
        V(X,Y) = -10 * d/dX ( PHI(X) * PHI(Y) )
      </b></pre>
      which guarantees zero divergence.
     </p>

    <p>
      The underlying function PHI is defined by
      <pre><b>
        PHI(Z) = ( 1 - cos ( C * pi * Z ) ) * ( 1 - Z )**2
      </b></pre>
      where C is a parameter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The velocity data satisifes the (continuous) continuity equation;
      this in <b>no way</b> implies that it satisfies the momentum equations
      associated with Stokes or Navier-Stokes flow!  Moreover, a flow solution
      for those equations would normally also require specifying a value
      for the scalar pressure field <b>P(X,Y)</b>.

      TABLE_COLUMNS <br> Extract a column from a file.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_COLUMNS</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      extracts specified columns of data from a text file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file is presumed to consist of lines of data.  
      Blank lines are ok, and are copied to the output file.  Lines beginning
      with a '#' in column 1 are treated as comments, and are copied
      to the output file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each line of data contains several words, separated by one or more
      spaces or TAB characters.  The first word in each line is the first 
      "column", and so on.  <b>TABLE_COLUMNS</b> is given a specificiation of
      which columns are to be copied, in what order, and how often,
      and copies the necessary information from each line of the input
      file to the output file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The specification of columns is simple.  You can simply list
      every column you want, separated by spaces, or if there are
      several consecutive columns in a row, you can use a colon
      to indicate a range.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program can be used in command line form:
      <blockquote>
        <b>table_columns</b>  <i>column_spec filein  fileout</i>
      </blockquote>
      or can be invoked interactively with no arguments, in which case
      the program will request information from the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, let us suppose that <i>file.txt</i> contains the lines:
      <pre>
        CAT RED   APPLE 9.5
        MOUSE  BLUE   ORANGE 
        DOG purple  Banana   34.7
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the command 
      <blockquote>
        <b>table_columns</b> </i>2 file.txt mydata.txt</i>
      </blockquote>
      will copy the following data into <i>mydata.txt</i>:
      <pre>
        RED
        BLUE
        purple
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The command 
      <blockquote>
        <b>table_columns</b> </i>2 3 2 file.txt mydata.txt</i>
      </blockquote>
      will create the file:
      <pre>
        RED APPLE RED
        BLUE ORANGE BLUE
        purple Banana purple
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The command 
      <blockquote>
        <b>table_columns</b> </i>2:4 2 2 file.txt mydata.txt</i>
      </blockquote>
      will create the file:
      <pre>
        RED   APPLE 9.5 RED RED
        BLUE   ORANGE *** BLUE BLUE
        purple  Banana   34.7 purple purple
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If some lines of the file do not have the full number of columns,
      then the program will print a "***" string for that value, which
      occurred in the last example above.

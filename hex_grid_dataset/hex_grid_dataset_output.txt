HEX_GRID_DATASET (FORTRAN90 version)
  Generate a hexagonal grid dataset.
 
  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input 
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * X1, Y1, the lower left corner of the region,
  * X2, Y2, the upper right corner of the region,
  * NODES_PER_LAYER, the number of nodes per layer,
 
  After the dataset of nodes is computed, it is
  written to a file, and another dataset may be made.
 
  *
 *
*  Ready to generate a new dataset:

  Enter X1, Y1, the lower left corner of the region:
  (Try '0, 0' if you do not have a preference.)
  (Enter "*" or "QUIT" to terminate execution.)
  User input X1, Y1 =    1.00000       2.00000    
 
  Enter X2, Y2, the upper right corner of the region:
  (Try '10, 10' if you do not have a preference.)
  (Enter "*" or "QUIT" to terminate execution.)
  User input X2, Y2 =    4.00000       7.00000    
 
  Enter NODES_PER_LAYER, the number of nodes in a layer.
  (Try '10' if you do not have a preference.)
  (1 or any smaller value terminates execution).
  User input NODES_PER_LAYER =           10
 
  The number of layers will be           18
  The X spacing will be   0.333333    
  The Y spacing will be   0.288675    
  The number of nodes          171
 
  The data was written to the file "hex_grid_10_18_171.txt".
 
  Enter "Y" if you want to define another dataset.
 
HEX_GRID_DATASET:
  Normal end of execution.
